                Before I put my fingers on the keyboard, I had a very difficult time figuring out how I wanted this website to look. Creative blocks are common, difficult, and experienced by everyone, though it was especially difficult for me. Funny enough, the way I got past this block was by literally googling “Simple aesthetic website design ideas”. Although the ideas presented to me by the search was limited (due to my abilities to code) I still managed to gather enough influence to create what you are seeing today. I do though, want to take the time to thank two people who helped me a lot during the process of making this website, Sherzod and Josh.

                I took a lot of inspiration from my friend Sherzod’s personal website. He has a very simple yet direct way of displaying information that was very captivating to me. Not only that, I admire his work ethic which also inspired me to continuously work on this website without ever experiencing any form of burnout. Ok. That’s all… Nothing more… I know that if I continue and he reads this, he’ll probably cry or something.

                Anyway, another person I want to take the time to thank is Josh. He is the sole reason I decided to create a website in the first place. Every time I hung out with him, he would try to teach me something new about HTML. He tried everything in his power to make building a website seem cool, which he managed to eventually do. When I finally decided to build this website, he was there every step of the process and was always eager to help out anyway he could. So for that I want to say thanks dude.

            <p>For the rest of my friends, if you ever read this, don’t worry, I’ll get to y’all eventually :). </p>
